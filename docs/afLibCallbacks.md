# Callbacks and Events

Calls to `af_lib_get_attribute()` and `af_lib_set_attribute*()` are enqueued for handling by afLib; and once handled, result in execution of a callback function named `attrEventCallback()`. You must define `attrEventCallback()` in your MCU code, and pass this function as an argument to `af_lib_create()`. This callback contains your application-specific code intended to respond to attribute changes.

Your `attrEventCallback()` will be called with an **event type** and an [**error code**](../afLibErrors). You’ll use these data to select an appropriate response. This page describes how your code can distinguish the events and respond accordingly.

## attrEventCallback()

### Description

Application callback that is executed any time ASR has data to communicate with the MCU.

### Syntax

```
void attrEventCallback(const af_lib_event_type_t eventType,
                       const af_lib_error_t error,
                       const uint16_t attributeId,
                       const uint16_t valueLen,
                       const uint8_t* value)
```

### Parameters

| `eventType`    | The event type for this request.                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `error`        | An [afLib result code](../afLibErrors) |
| `attribute_id` | The ID of the attribute involved.                            |
| `value_len`    | The size in bytes of the attribute value.                    |
| `value`        | The new value for the attribute.                             |

#### Event Types

The following event types are defined in `af_lib.h`:

| EVENT TYPE                            | INTERPRETATION                                               |
| :------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| AF_LIB_EVENT_UNKNOWN                  | This event is not normally seen; it’s intended for debugging. |
| AF_LIB_EVENT_ASR_SET_RESPONSE         | Calling `af_lib_set_attribute()` on a non-MCU attribute will return the results of the set via this event. |
| AF_LIB_EVENT_MCU_SET_REQ_SENT         | Calling `af_lib_set_attribute()` on an MCU attribute will return this event when the request has been sent to ASR. |
| AF_LIB_EVENT_MCU_SET_REQ_REJECTION    | This event is sent when `af_lib_set_attribute()` for an MCU attribute was rejected by ASR. |
| AF_LIB_EVENT_MCU_GET_REQUEST          | This event is sent when ASR needs to verify the value of an MCU attribute. |
| AF_LIB_EVENT_GET_RESPONSE             | Calling `af_lib_get_attribute()` on any attribute will return the value via this event. |
| AF_LIB_EVENT_MCU_DEFAULT_NOTIFICATION | Unsolicited notification from ASR informing the MCU that an MCU attribute has a default value in its Profile. |
| AF_LIB_EVENT_ASR_NOTIFICATION         | Unsolicited notification of non-MCU attribute change.        |
| AF_LIB_EVENT_MCU_SET_REQUEST          | Request from ASR to MCU to set an MCU attribute, requires a call to `af_lib_send_set_response()`. |
| AF_LIB_EVENT_COMMUNICATION_BREAKDOWN  | Communication between the MCU and ASR seems to have stopped; take the appropriate action (i.e. reboot ASR). |

### Returns

None.

### Special Case: MCU Confirmation of Attribute Set Requests by ASR

Requests from ASR to set an MCU attribute value will arrive at the MCU via an AF_LIB_EVENT_MCU_SET_REQUEST event in the `attrEventCallback()`. It is the responsibility of the MCU to act on the request as appropriate, and then respond True or False, indicating whether or not the set was completed as requested, via the `af_lib_send_set_response()` call.

### Special Case: MCU Attribute Reconciliation (aka “MCU Update All”)

The Afero system requires that all attributes be in sync in all places that may be monitoring that attribute. In general, this means that at the very least, the MCU, ASR, and the Afero Cloud all must agree on the value of any given attribute. Other components, such as the Afero mobile app, Afero Inspector, and other applications connected to the same account also must be in sync on the value of any attribute.

For any non-MCU attributes, this reconciliation is easy: the Afero Cloud (via ASR) is the authoritative source for all non-MCU attributes. When your application starts, or any time ASR is rebooted and reconnects to the network, you will receive AF_LIB_EVENT_ASR_NOTIFICATION events for all non-MCU attributes, and all you must do is to listen for, and potentially act on, any of those attributes you care about. Your application will potentially receive a large number of these events at ASR connection time; many of them can be safely ignored by most MCU applications. Other attributes are critical to the operation of your MCU application and need to be handled; for example, AF_SYSTEM_ASR_STATE, which tells your application what’s happening on ASR so you can communicate with it.

For MCU attributes, your application is the authoritative source. MCU attributes can map to physical device state, sensor readings, or user preferences, and there’s no way for the Afero Cloud to know the current state of these attributes without asking your application about them. When ASR knows that the Afero Cloud does not have the correct values for your MCU’s attributes, it will ask your application to give the correct MCU attribute values by sending AF_LIB_EVENT_GET_REQUEST events for any attributes that it needs. When ASR first reboots and connects to the network, you should expect one of these events for every MCU attribute in your Profile. During normal operation, there may be rare times when ASR will ask for one or more current values of MCU attributes to verify that the values on the network are in fact current. You can respond to these events by sending an `af_lib_set_attribute()` callback to afLib, with the reason type of AF_LIB_SET_REASON_GET_RESPONSE, along with the current value of the attribute.

## af_lib_send_set_response()

### Description

Call required in response to callback event AF_LIB_EVENT_MCU_SET_REQUEST, which is used by MCU to confirm/deny that the set request by ASR was successfully completed by the MCU. If the MCU was able to set the attribute to the requested value, then this call can just return the values passed to it in this callback. If the MCU was unable to set the requested value, then this call should return the value that the MCU will use instead of the value requested.

### Syntax

```
void af_lib_send_set_response(af_lib_t *af_lib, 
                       const uint16_t attribute_id,
                       bool set_succeeded,
                       const uint16_t value_len, 
                       const uint8_t *value)
```

### Parameters

| `af_lib`        | Pointer to the active aflib instance.                        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `attr_id`       | The attribute ID for which set request was sent.             |
| `set_succeeded` | Boolean indicating whether or not MCU successfully changed attribute the value. |
| `valueLen`      | The size in bytes of the attribute value.                    |
| `value`         | The value for the attribute.                                 |

### Returns

Error.

### Example 1: Translating End-User Actions and afLib Function Calls into Events

`attrEventCallback()` will be called by afLib whenever ASR has information for the MCU. Your code will use the eventType parameter to determine why the callback has been fired, and therefore how you want to respond.

Let’s consider a few specific cases, just to make this clear:

- If the button is pressed on an Afero dev board (changing the value of GPIO 3 directly), the `attrEventCallback()` will be executed with eventType AF_LIB_EVENT_ASR_NOTIFICATION.

- If your MCU code calls `af_lib_get_attribute()`, the value will be returned via the callback with eventType AF_LIB_EVENT_GET_RESPONSE.

- Consider that an end-user taps a control in your mobile application to change an attribute value. If the attribute changed is a GPIO, your code will be informed of the change by `attrEventCallback()` with eventType AF_LIB_EVENT_ASR_NOTIFICATION.

**However…**

- If the attribute changed by the mobile app is an MCU attribute, your code will receive AF_LIB_EVENT_MCU_SET_REQUEST.

- Your MCU application may receive events of type AF_LIB_EVENT_MCU_DEFAULT_NOTIFICATION. These events are sent for each MCU attribute in the Profile for which a default value was defined. The AF_LIB_EVENT_MCU_DEFAULT_NOTIFICATION event is purely informational, and no action is required. However, the use of default values in the profile provides a useful mechanism for field-updatable configuration values, for example, and in such a use, the AF_LIB_EVENT_MCU_DEFAULT_NOTIFICATION event is the opportunity for an application to receive default values.

- After receiving any AF_LIB_EVENT_MCU_DEFAULT_NOTIFICATION events, the MCU application will receive an AF_LIB_EVENT_MCU_GET_REQUEST for every MCU attribute defined. It is the responsibility of the MCU to respond to _each_ of these events with an `af_lib_set_attribute()`call…the calls will be in one of two forms:

    - If your application is designed so that a reboot should cause a given attribute to reset to the value specified in the device Profile, then `af_lib_set_attribute()` should be called with the value sent in the AF_LIB_EVENT_MCU_DEFAULT_NOTIFICATION event. This scheme can be useful when you want to be able to change default attribute values for devices in the field via an OTA update.
    - If your application is designed so that the current value of an attribute as held by the MCU is the value to be used, regardless of reboots, then `af_lib_set_attribute()` should be called with the attribute value held by the MCU. This scheme can be useful when your application assumes the MCU will ensure continuity of attribute values despite any reboots of ASR, for example, because of a Profile OTA.
    - In BOTH forms, the **reason** parameter to the `af_lib_set_attribute()` call should be AF_LIB_SET_REASON_GET_RESPONSE, indicating that the set is a response to the AF_LIB_EVENT_MCU_GET_REQUEST event.

- **IMPORTANT**: The AF_LIB_EVENT_MCU_DEFAULT_NOTIFICATION and AF_LIB_EVENT_MCU_GET_REQUEST events will be sent during the "attribute update-all" sequence that is part of the boot process. This sequence happens **before** your application enters the AF_MODULE_STATE_INITIALIZED state – and you must not call `af_lib_set_attribute()` until after you enter AF_MODULE_STATE_INITIALIZED. This means your application code may need to temporarily store each pending attribute value upon receipt of the AF_LIB_EVENT_MCU_DEFAULT_NOTIFICATION, and then use the stored value(s) once the application state reaches AF_MODULE_STATE_INITIALIZED.

### Example 2: Structure of a Prototypical attrEventCallback()

Typically, your callback code will branch on the eventType, and within each case, will branch again depending on the attributeID. Given that, below is an example “shell” of an `attrEventCallback()` that has a case for all eventTypes, and is also set up with cases for all system states, in the case of an AF_LIB_EVENT_ASR_NOTIFICATION event for attribute AF_SYSTEM_ASR_STATE. You might find this useful to copy/paste into your code:

```
// Callback executed any time ASR has information for the MCU
void attrEventCallback(const af_lib_event_type_t eventType,
             const af_lib_error_t error,
             const uint16_t attributeId,
             const uint16_t valueLen,
             const uint8_t* value) {

  switch (eventType) {
    case AF_LIB_EVENT_UNKNOWN:
      // Should never occur (indicates an eventType = 0); primarily for debugging
      break;

    case AF_LIB_EVENT_ASR_SET_RESPONSE:
      // Response to af_lib_set_attribute() for an ASR attribute
      break;

    case AF_LIB_EVENT_MCU_SET_REQ_SENT:
      // Request from af_lib_set_attribute() for an MCU attribute has been sent to ASR
      break;

    case AF_LIB_EVENT_MCU_SET_REQ_REJECTION:
      // Request from af_lib_set_attribute() for an MCU attribute was rejected by ASR
      break;

    case AF_LIB_EVENT_MCU_GET_REQUEST:
      // Request from ASR for the current value of a specific MCU attribute.
      // You can expect such a request at reboot time, for each MCU attribute in profile.
      // MCU should respond with a set for each, or (typically) set a marker indicating a 
      // need to call setAttribute for the attribute (which is handled in loop())
      break;

    case AF_LIB_EVENT_ASR_GET_RESPONSE:
      // Response to af_lib_get_attribute()
      break;

    case AF_LIB_EVENT_MCU_DEFAULT_NOTIFICATION:
      // Unsolicited default notification for an MCU attribute
      // As of afLib4, this has become purely informational;
      // no response is required, and this event merely informs MCU of 
      // default values specified in profile. MCU may or may not use them.
      break;

    case AF_LIB_EVENT_ASR_NOTIFICATION:
      // Unsolicited notification of non-MCU attribute change
      switch (attributeId) {

        case AF_SYSTEM_ASR_STATE:
          switch (value[0]) {
            case AF_MODULE_STATE_REBOOTED:
              // ASR has rebooted. MCU Attributes are erased and must be reset
              break;

            case AF_MODULE_STATE_LINKED:
              // Linked - ASR has rebooted (MCU Attributes erased) and then linked
              break;

            case AF_MODULE_STATE_UPDATING:
              // Updating - There's an OTA in progress
              break;

            case AF_MODULE_STATE_UPDATE_READY:
              // Update ready - OTA is complete; reboot needed to begin using the new code
              break;

            case AF_MODULE_STATE_INITIALIZED:
              // Initialized - ASR now ready to service requests
              break;

            case AF_MODULE_STATE_RELINKED:
              //Relinked - ASR has relinked with cloud
              break;

            case AF_MODULE_STATE_FACTORY_RESET:
              // Factory reset has occurred; MCU should take any necessary local steps, then reboot ASR
              break;

            default:
              Serial.print("Unexpected state - "); Serial.println(value[0]);
              break;
          }
          break;

        default:
          break;
      }
      break;

    case AF_LIB_EVENT_MCU_SET_REQUEST:
      // Request from ASR to MCU to set an MCU attribute, requires a call to af_lib_send_set_response()
      switch (attributeId) {

        default:
          break;
      }
      break;

    default:
      break;
  }
}
```

### Example 3: afBlink

This afBlink example uses a Teensy to control the LED onboard an Afero development board. The LED can be made to start/stop blinking by a tap on a UI control in the mobile app, or by a press on the dev board button. The key lesson from this example comes from understanding how the code in `attrEventCallback()` distinguishes between various events, and handles them accordingly. Here are four cases:

- In the case of a tap on the “Start” button in the mobile app UI…

    - The mobile app translates the button tap into an `af_lib_set_bool()` for attribute AF_BLINK.
    - As a result, `attrEventCallback()` will be called with an eventType AF_LIB_EVENT_MCU_SET_REQUEST and attributeId AF_BLINK.
    - So, when we get eventType AF_LIB_EVENT_MCU_SET_REQUEST belonging to attribute AF_BLINK, our code sets the value of our variable `blinking`, and then calls `af_lib_send_set_response` to confirm that MCU was able to update its state.
    - Within our `loop()` function, if `blinking` is true, we call `toggleLED()` every two seconds, which blinks the LED!

- In the case of a button press on the Afero dev board…

    - The Afero dev board changes the local attribute value and sends an update, which causes…
    - `attrEventCallback()` to be called with an eventType AF_LIB_EVENT_ASR_NOTIFICATION and attributeId AF_MODULO_BUTTON.
    - When we get eventType AF_LIB_EVENT_ASR_NOTIFICATION, belonging to attribute `AF_MODULO_BUTTON`, our code toggles the value of our global `curButtonValue`.
    - Within our `loop()` function, if our `curButtonValue` is different from `prevButtonValue` (that is, if the button value has changed), then we call `af_lib_set_bool()` on AF_BLINK, setting that attribute, which controls blinking.
    - *That* `af_lib_set_bool()` call triggers the same sequence of events as example #1 above, which results in the LED blinking.

- **Any time the Afero dev board reboots…** <br>The MCU is required to call `set_attribute` for each MCU attribute whenever ASR reboots, so:

    - Upon reboot, `attrEventCallback()` will be called with an eventType AF_LIB_EVENT_ASR_NOTIFICATION and attributeId AF_SYSTEM_ASR_STATE.

    - Presented that combination of eventType and attributeId, our code checks the `value` delivered via the callback; in this case, that value is AF_MODULE_STATE_REBOOTED.

    - Our code responds by setting `initializationPending` and `attr1SyncPending` to true. Both values are checked in `loop()`:

        - Any time `initializationPending` is true, we avoid making afLib calls until we receive the AF_SYSTEM_ASR_STATE AF_MODULE_STATE_INITIALIZED signal that tells us that ASR is ready to handle requests.
        
        - If `attr1SyncPending` is true, we call `af_lib_set_attribute_bool` for attribute 1 (AF_BLINK), setting it to the current value of the `blinking` variable.

- **If the Afero dev board receives an OTA update…**

  - When the OTA is complete, `attrEventCallback()` will be called with an eventType AF_LIB_EVENT_ASR_NOTIFICATION and attributeId AF_SYSTEM_ASR_STATE.
  - We check the `value` delivered via the callback; in this case it’s AF_MODULE_UPDATE_READY.
  - Our code responds by setting `rebootPending` to true. This value is checked in `loop()`, and if true, we trigger a reboot.

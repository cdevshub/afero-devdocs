# Customize QR Code Labels

The QR code contains an Association ID that is used by the Afero mobile app to onboard the device. It is critical that the correct QR code label be physically applied to the module that generated it.

Every label must include the following two pieces of information:

- QR code, and
- Plain-text version of the Association ID

For more technical QR code information, please refer to the [QR Codes for Afero Products](../QRCodes) page.

The AFP2 Factory Provisioning package includes `.json` files that define the elements of the QR code + text label. (These files are found in the directory `\targets\*ProgrammerName*\labels\`.) The reference code in these files is compatible with Zebra printers (ZPL format) and is commented for ease of use.

**By default, the following configuration is defined in the reference code:**

- **Standard label sizes:** 1.5-inch x 0.5-inch (module label) in 300dpi, and 45x30mm (customer-visible label) in 300dpi
- **Supported 300dpi printers:** Zebra 105SL Plus or Zebra GX430T
- **Module label includes:** P/N (part number) and FCCID, which must be filled out by the customer/manufacturer

If the print job settings require customization, the operator can do that in the correct `.json` file within the `\targets\*ProgrammerName*\labels\` directory:

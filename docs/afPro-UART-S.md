# afPro UART Protocol - A Practical Guide

This page describes a single path through the UART protocol, the minimum required for an MCU to communicate over UART. The full explanation is covered in [afPro UART Protocol - How It Works](https://afero-devdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/afPro-UART) and includes all the corner cases.

The high-level interactions between the MCU and ASR are outlined below in [Protocol Flow](https://afero-devdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/afPro-UART-S/#protocol-flow). The details of each interaction are described in the second section, [Procedure Descriptions](https://afero-devdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/afPro-UART-S/#protocol-procedures). The last section, [Attribute Data](https://afero-devdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/afPro-UART-S/#attribute-data), provides a handy worksheet for defining and mapping attributes to protocol messages, illustrated with our smart toaster oven data model from [Great Attribute Modeling](https://afero-devdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/AttrModel).

## Protocol Flow

The protocol flow consists of four high-level interactions (Boot Process, New Attribute Value to MCU, New Attribute Value to ASR), all described below.

### MCU: Boot Process

1. The MCU reboots ASR via Reset line. (Refer to diagram below.)![Block Diagram Showing Reset Line](img/BlockDiag.png)
2. After ASR boots, ASR starts [Init Procedure](https://afero-devdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/afPro-UART-S/#init-procedure) with the MCU.
3. ASR starts [ASR to MCU Notify Procedure](https://afero-devdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/afPro-UART-S/#asr-to-mcu-notify-procedure) with the MCU.
4. Repeat Step 3 until Attribute ID 0xF5FD (ASR State) has Value=0x04 (Initialized).
5. After Step 4, the MCU can start sending attributes.

### ASR: Afero Platform Notifications to Send to MCU

ASR starts [ASR to MCU Notify Procedure](https://afero-devdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/afPro-UART-S/#asr-to-mcu-notify-procedure) with MCU.

### ASR: Product-Specific Commands to Send to MCU

ASR starts [ASR to MCU Command Procedure](https://afero-devdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/afPro-UART-S/#asr-to-mcu-command-procedure) with the MCU.

### MCU: Product-Specific Notifications to Send to ASR

The MCU starts [MCU to ASR Notify Procedure](https://afero-devdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/afPro-UART-S/#mcu-to-asr-notify-procedure) with ASR.

## Protocol Procedures

The following applies to the procedures detailed below:

- All values are in little endian.
- Checksum = Byte addition.
- If ASR does not reply to any message from the MCU within 10 seconds, the MCU will reset ASR using the Reset line.

### Init Procedure

This procedure is only performed during the boot process.

### ASR to MCU Notify Procedure

GG=0x0D & TTTT=0xF5FD; if TTTT!=0xF5FD, then discard

ASR notifies MCU of Afero System Attribute changes.

This example is designed to demonstrate basic principles while keeping things simple. The suggestion “if TTTT!=0xF5FD, then discard” is based on that idea of simplicity, but deserves some explanation, below.

The attribute ID 0xF5FD translates to 65013 decimal… which is ASR_SYSTEM_STATE. Even a simple application must watch for messages with this attribute ID, for a couple reasons:

- After a reboot, an MCU must wait for an ASR_SYSTEM_STATE message with value AF_MODULE_STATE_INITIALIZED before it is allowed to begin sending afLib commands.
- At any time, if the device receives an Over-The-Air application update, MCU will receive an ASR_SYSTEM_STATE with value AF_MODULE_STATE_UPDATE_READY when the update has been completely received. At that point, the MCU should trigger a reboot of ASR, to install the new software.

So, in the case of a very simple application (like this example), your code could choose to ignore ASR-to-MCU Notifications EXCEPT those where attribute ID is 65013. Those notifications must be handled, even by simple applications.

### ASR to MCU Command Procedure

GG=0x0B

ASR sends command to MCU, MCU acknowledges that command was successful (SS=0x00), or failed (SS=0x05).

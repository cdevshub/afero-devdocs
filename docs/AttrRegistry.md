# Device Attribute Registry

Each Afero device will have a number of attributes associated with it. Attributes are identified by a 2-byte ID and can contain a variable amount of information based on the type of attribute. Attributes can come in many types and have specific ID ranges.

| ID     | DESCRIPTION                       | DATA TYPE | USAGE NOTES                                                  |
| ----- | -------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1‑1023 | Afero Cloud, Device MCU           |           | An attribute residing on an external MCU defined by the third-party developer. The size and meaning of these attributes are defined by the developer using the Afero Profile Editor. To get the default value of one of these attributes, the MCU must call `af_lib_get_attribute`. |
| 1024   | I/O 0 Value Attribute             |           | LED on Afero dev board.                                      |

| 1201   | UTC Time                          | SINT32    | Local UTC time on ASR should the MCU need/want it. If present in the Profile, ASR will deliver it to the MCU periodically. |
| 1202   | Device ID                         | BYTES     | If the MCU requires the ASR Device ID, the MCU can do a GET on this attribute to retrieve the ID. |
| 1203   | Association ID                    | BYTES     | Should the MCU require the Association ID of the ASR it can do a GET on this attribute to retrieve it. |
| 1204   | Company Code                      | SINT8     | Should the MCU require the Company Code of the ASR it can do a GET on this attribute to retrieve it. |
| 1205   | Online Status                     | BYTES     | This three-byte array describes the online status of the device according to the following formula:<br>•First byte: 0 = Offline, 1 = Online<br>•Second byte: 1 = BLE, 2 = Wi-Fi<br>•Third byte: Number of Wi-Fi bars (if second byte is 2) |
| 1206   | Device Capabilities               | BYTES     | A bit field in which the device states to the MCU what capabilities it supports. Bits are indexed from left to right, allowing additional bytes to be appended to support additional capabilities. The bits are:<br>•Bit 0: MCU OTA Support |
| 1207   | afLib Capabilities                | BYTES     | A bit field in which afLib states to ASR what capabilities it supports. Bits are indexed from left to right, allowing additional bytes to be appended to support additional capabilities. |

| 1302   | OTA MCU Transfer                  | BYTES     | N-byte array used for transmitting the image data to the MCU. By default this will be 510 bytes for Modulo-1 and 2046 bytes for Modulo-2, but the MCU can limit the amount of data it receives each time by lowering the size of this attribute. |
| 2001   | Bootloader Version                | SINT64    | The bootloader is always the first thing to be upgraded as it is responsible for installing firmware images. This firmware type is used for the Afero Secure Hub and Afero Secure Radios. |
| 2002   | BLE Stack Version                 | SINT64    | This is the Bluetooth stack for the radio module. This will likely never be updated, but is included here for completeness. If the stack is updated, the application must always be updated at the same time, before the device is rebooted. |
| 2003   | FW Application Version            | SINT64    | This is the radio module application responsible for reading the device description and handling attributes. This firmware type is used for the Afero Secure Hub and Afero Secure Radios. |

| 2007   | Wi-Fi Certificates                | SINT64    | This is the package of Wi-Fi certificates used by the Wi-Fi chip to talk to the Cloud. This includes specific server certificates for Conclave and OTA servers as well as their root certificates. There is only one slot for this image type and the binary image is signed on the way to the device. |
| 2008   | WAN APN List                      | SINT64    | This package contains a single file that comprises all the different WAN APNs the device supports. |
| 65001  | UTC offset data                   | BYTES     | Contains the current UTC offset in minutes, the next timestamp to change the UTC offset, and the new UTC offset to apply at the previous timestamp, in that order (2-bytes signed short, 4-bytes int, 2-bytes signed short). |
| 65004  | Configured SSID                   | UTF8S     | The SSID the Afero Secure Hub is currently configured to use. |

# Device Attribute Registry

Each Afero device will have a number of attributes associated with it. Attributes are identified by a 2-byte ID and can contain a variable amount of information based on the type of attribute. Attributes can come in many types and have specific ID ranges.

| ID     | DESCRIPTION                       | DATA TYPE | USAGE NOTES                                                  |

| 1â€‘1023 | Afero Cloud, Device MCU           |           | An attribute residing on an external MCU defined by the third-party developer. The size and meaning of these attributes are defined by the developer using the Afero Profile Editor. To get the default value of one of these attributes, the MCU must call `af_lib_get_attribute`. |

| 1201   | UTC Time                          | SINT32    | Local UTC time on ASR should the MCU need/want it. If present in the Profile, ASR will deliver it to the MCU periodically. |
| 1202   | Device ID                         | BYTES     | If the MCU requires the ASR Device ID, the MCU can do a GET on this attribute to retrieve the ID. |
| 1203   | Association ID                    | BYTES     | Should the MCU require the Association ID of the ASR it can do a GET on this attribute to retrieve it. |
| 1204   | Company Code                      | SINT8     | Should the MCU require the Company Code of the ASR it can do a GET on this attribute to retrieve it. |

| 1206   | Device Capabilities               | BYTES     | A bit field in which the device states to the MCU what capabilities it supports. Bits are indexed from left to right, allowing additional bytes to be appended to support additional capabilities. The bits are:Bit 0: MCU OTA Support |

| 1302   | OTA MCU Transfer                  | BYTES     | N-byte array used for transmitting the image data to the MCU. By default this will be 510 bytes for Modulo-1 and 2046 bytes for Modulo-2, but the MCU can limit the amount of data it receives each time by lowering the size of this attribute. |
| 2001   | Bootloader Version                | SINT64    | The bootloader is always the first thing to be upgraded as it is responsible for installing firmware images. This firmware type is used for the Afero Secure Hub and Afero Secure Radios. |
